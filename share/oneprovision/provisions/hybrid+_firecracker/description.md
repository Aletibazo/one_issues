The Firecracker provision uses the Firecracker virtualization technology to start VMs in virtualized hosts. It is useful for developing and testing purposes. It features the following characteristics:

* Hosts are provisioned as VMs in the selected provider
* The provision includes a public network (Internet reachable IPs)
* It also includes a virtual network template to create private VLANs. You need to instantiate this network template.

More information about using this provision can be found in the [OpenNebula documentation](https://opennebula.io)
